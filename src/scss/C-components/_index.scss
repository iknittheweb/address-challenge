//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//* COMPONENTS: INDEX PARTIAL
//*
//* Use this file to forward all component partials (buttons, cards, forms, etc.).
//* Only @forward statements should be in this file.
//* Do NOT put any CSS rules, selectors, or variable/mixin definitions here.
//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//& THE /COMPONENTS FOLDER
//* The /components folder is dedicated to reusable UI components that can be used across different parts of the website. Each component gets its own partial file.

//& Why It’s Important:
//* Organizing components separately makes it easier to manage and reuse UI elements, leading to a more modular and maintainable codebase.
